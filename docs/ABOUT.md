# About

Leveraging GraalVM native-image and the [Small Clojure Interpreter](https://github.com/borkdude/sci), [babashka](https://babashka.org/) is a self-contained and instantly starting scripting environment that runs on linux, macOS and Windows.

Babashka implements a substantial subset of Clojure and comes included with many libraries for common tasks. Besides the built-in libraries, babashka is able to load libraries from source, tapping into the world of already existing Clojure libraries.
